We left the I-10 to visit Marfa, Texas, a small town that is noteworthy mainly for two reasons: in the 1950s the movie Giant was filmed here, starring Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson, and James Dean; and in the 1970s the minimalist sculptor Donald Judd moved here from NYC, taking over disused Air Force facilities to use as gigantic studio space. Today, it is an outpost of SoHo in West Texas. But on the Monday when we visited, most everything was closed. We shall return, perhaps on the return trip, if the timing is better.
