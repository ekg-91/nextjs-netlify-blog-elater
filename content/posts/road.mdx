When you're driving an electric car, regular stops at charging stations are part of the program. For three years I can charge for free at Electrify America, so that's where we stop. The EA chargers are mainly located in the parking lots of Targets and Walmarts not far from an Interstate exit. The ID.4 is still pretty new, so everyone who's got one is still learning how it works. Little "owners' clubs" form quickly at practically every charging stop.
