We went a little bit out of our way (off the I-10) to visit Marfa, Texas, a small town that is noteworthy mainly for two reasons: in the 1950s, the movie Giant was filmed here, starring Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson, and James Dean; and in the 1970s the minimalist sculptor Donald Judd moved here from NYC, taking over some abandoned Air Force facilities to use as gigantic studio space. Now the town is a little bit of SoHo in West Texas, but our visit was on a Monday, so unfortunately most everything was closed.
