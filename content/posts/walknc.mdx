On Sunday afternoon we took an hour-long walk in William B. Umstad State Park, just outside Raleigh NC. The woods were expansive, the trees were much taller than we are used to at home. The weather was warmer than in the Northeast. It felt great to stretch our legs after a long day in the car on Saturday. We could hear trains in the distance (a welcome sound), and jet planes low overhead (not a welcome sound).
