On Thursday morning we set out from home, headed for Albany NY, the first leg of a trip that will take us south to Atlanta, and then west to Los Angeles. We have the time, the electric car (VW ID.4), and free charging on Electrify America. The plan is to see family, friends, and a generous swath of the country.
