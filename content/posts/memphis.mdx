In Memphis we visited the Cotton Museum. Of course I associate Memphis with music, and particularly with Sun Records, where Elvis Presley first recorded. But there is a lot more to the story. At the museum, they are doing a good job of incorporating the historical contributions made by African-Americans. In particular, the museum makes the case that the cotton economy created the environment for the emergence of the blues, and that this is essentially the foundation of American Civilization.
